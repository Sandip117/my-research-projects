Staff was very helpful and friendly."
1,VR6GpWIda3SfvPC-lg9H3w,5,"Small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often. Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. 

We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. 

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station."
2,CKC0-MOWMqoeWf6s-szl8g,5,"Lester's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951. They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. 

The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well."
3,ACFtxLv8pGrrxMm6EgjreA,4,"Love coming here. Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. 

The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. 

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag."
4,s2I_Ni76bjJNK9yG60iD-Q,4,"Had their chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing! So light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty.

If you're looking for a light breakfast then head out here. Perfect spot for a coffee\/latt√© before heading out to the old port"
5,9_CGhHMz8698M9-PkVf0CQ,4,"Who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent Vietnamese restaurant in East York? 

Not quite the same as Chinatown in terms of pricing (slightly higher) but definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood. When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.

So far the only items I have tried are the phos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) - and they have not disappointed me! Especially the chicken pho.

Next time I go back, I'm going to try the banh cuon (steamed rice noodle) and the vermicelli!"
6,5r6-G9C4YLbC7Ziz57l3rQ,3,"Not bad!! Love that there is a gluten-free, vegan version of the cheese curds and gravy!!

Haven't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke's but Im excited to see which is better. However poutini's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free"
7,XWTPNfskXoUL-Lf32wSk0Q,3,"Server was a little rude.

Ordered the calamari, duck confit poutine and the trout fish with miso soba - all very tasty. Definitely not your typical diner."
8,RtUvSWO_UZ8V3Wpj0n077w,3,"Wanted to check out this place due to all the hype I had heard. My friend wanted to come here for her birthday. We had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works (as it is communal), we wind up sharing with another group of five. 

Food was ok - not sure what the hype was. Almost 75% of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it.

This place is very loud so not ideal for catching up\/talking. Not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions.

Interesting concept. Would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait."
9,Aov96CM4FZAXeZvKtsStdA,5,"This place is awesome! Definitely authentic!!!

My two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho. The rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever I'm there! And the chicken pho is always flavourful!! mmmm....just thinking of it makes me want some!

My boyfriend is Vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at.

Prices are very reasonable too!"
10,0W4lkclzZThpx3V65bVgig,4,"a must stop when you are in montreal!

I was in Mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row!

The sandwiches here are unbelieveable! The smoked meat is so tasty and salty but so good. The bread definitely complements the meat!

Not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening.

Remember to leave a tip in the plate when you order take out and the servers will be extra nice and funny!"
11,oWTn2IzrprsRkPfULtjZtQ,3,"Came here for a burger as one of my friends said they had good burgers and people from work would come by twice a month for a burger run.

Ordered the original was was ok, wasn't as amazing as everyone says it to be. I think the veggie option would have been better.

A little pricy for a take-out burger."
12,zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ,1,"really excited to hear of this restaurant coming to Toronto. When it finally opened, my friend and I were really excited to try this place.

Service here is not great, it felt like they had forgotten about us and that they didn't care about the service as everything came out one at a time. My friend and I had each ordered a ginger beer, which came out at two separate times (it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that's how long it took).

There is absolutely no vegetarian options, except for the one cold noodle - the mushroom bun is not vegetarian.

The pork belly bun was nothing special - just a piece of meat with the bun. For my vegetarian friend, we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well, and they literally just gave it to us plain, with no sauce, no kimchi.

The Momofuko ramen was awful. It was bland and mushy. After a few bites, I couldn't handle eating anymore.

Momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen. I've had better experience with instant noodles."
13,28adZ4lsuUeVB2aWzohK9g,3,"was always intrigued of this place when I pass by on the streetcar. Finally decided to try this place out this past summer. Read the reviews and everyone had lots of good things to say.

one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads. Just let the server know when you come in.

excited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are salads. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't salads on the menu.

So we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave). 

In reading the reviews, everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine, we had ordered that to try. It wasn't bad, but not sure what the hype was about. Definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing!"
14,N93EYZy9R0sdlEvubu94ig,3,"Not sure what the hype is, but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews.

Maybe it was too hyped up, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Maybe it was what we had ordered, but it was just ok. We had ordered the kimchi fries, which was kind of like a NY Fries ""the works"". The grilled pork banh mi was ok. 

Will be back to try other stuff, like the bao version and the pork belly."
15,4_GIJk0tX3k0x0FcUv4sNA,4,"Hidden on the east end of the Danforth is a lovely Thai restaurant. Found this restaurant while surfing on Yelp.

Surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available. They are mainly a take-out restaurant, as many of the customers came in for take-out, and the service was a little bit slow. However, the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers, vegans, etc.

Definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there, stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste, just coconut favour. But the Roti itself was really good.

Most of the dishes were under $10 - definitely a good deal!

Will be back to try the noodle dishes!"
16,a9aW5e731lplWGHUZ02-zQ,4,"Decided to try this place after reading the reviews. Was not disappointed. Huge portions and a bit of a long wait. They will take phone orders over the walk ins. So call ahead to order!

Tried the burrito with rice but will be back to try the noodle version!!"
17,0-yj2jtzLUHG2b7PpEHyog,4,"Hidden in the east end of the Danforth, who knew there would be a little Ethiopian community?

The decor is definitely interesting. Although, the outside has lots of lights as decoration, the inside is kind of dark. The red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read.

The food is not bad. Although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing!"
18,Tn8O4tv1U-n0PRC8kbJJPg,4,"Great place in Chinatown to get banh mi! Just make sure you know what you want as it is really crazy in there and hectic! The ladies behind the counter will harass you until you move along!

Lots of great prepacked food as well, if the sandwich isn't your thing!"
19,D2PmpZYRdRnzL7q4Wprf3Q,4,"cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the Woodbine\/Danforth area.

bf ordered a coffee here that he thought was pretty good. they seem to have smoothies and fresh juices as well. and nifty rice bowls. 

will be back to try out the juices and food.

seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours."
20,BmSLyxm8b86dtzwuT7LqBA,4,"The loud banging always draws crowds as you walk by and see that the chef is making fresh noodles. Noodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall!

After trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodles. There is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourful. Plus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good.

Because of Sun's dan dan noodles - my bf and I will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far, no one has the same flavour as Sun's. Sun's    is the best we have had!!!"
21,pZ1quwXnYozLIZIVABojhw,4,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. At first, I wasn't impress that it was a 45 mins wait, however my BF really wanted to try this piece, so we decided to wait.

It was definitely different and worth the wait. 

We started off with the House Cured Meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people).

Next came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering. Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!

Then came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.

Tongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.

For dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting. It was good, but after 4 dishes already, this was just a little too rich. It came with banana bread that was really good.

Overall, definitely worth the try! Just make sure you bring cash =)"
22,3vs6rARRBm-O99y4bryilw,4,"Great Japanese restaurant in the Bloor and Church area. Been coming here since the first opened years ago.

Food has always been good and fresh. However, if you are here for lunch, it will take an hour and make sure you come a few minutes earlier otherwise it may be a long wait as it is small inside!"
23,FQr_scgz9a4sXTdRS4d3mg,3,"Nice place by Cumberland place. After we had sat down, we were given two HUGE blown up pitas. So we had ordered the eggplant dip to go with it. It had a nice smoked flavour to it but not even garlic taste for my liking so it was just a-ok.

Ordered a chicken shawarma and a mango strawberry juice. The juice was yummy and would definitely order it again! The shawarma - I'm not sure about it. The meat wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. Maybe I need to try the falafel instead next time."
24,3RlylOY452bA8rwliPUeUQ,4,"My sister loves this place! Probably comes by once a week, once every two weeks!

The hot pot for two is a great deal! Lots of food that can probably feed 3 (assuming you aren't  huge eaters - just regular eaters).

When it's not hot pot time, my sister says they have really good Hot Stone Bibimbap - which is what she typically gets."
25,SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg,4,"Long line ups for Sunday brunch - but so worth it!

The baked French Toast is amazing!! Very big portion though!

The butter tart was definitely the best butter tart I've ever had.

Note: it is a very small cafe, not good for large groups."
26,lRwpFFaFr3QQ5fGHkk3eXQ,4,"Stumbled upon this one day - thought I would give it a try.

Typical sushi place - sushi was pretty good. Price is decent.

Party trays are decent. =)"
27,IBZ6e3P0OqcPXVjvGlpueQ,4,"Fish is good, really good. Love how you could have so many different options for fish choices. Chips is only ok. Onion rings are not the same as the regular onions, a little too crispy.

I had ordered the house organic batter mahi mahi - very light, not really heavy. Creamy coleslaw is flavourless. Shared the O.T.H Poutine which was ok but not for me. Will go back to try the pull pork or duck confit one. 

Good for gluten free. =)"
28,806kkDGaRCJ4lZLRcEf-iw,1,"after reading the reviews on yelp, my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try, especially since we are on a mission to try ramen in every city we visit.

we were really excited, as when we were in NYC, we had really good ramen. 

listening to the reviews we started off with the gyoza appetizer - which was not as good as everyone says it is. It was pan fried with the thin layer of skin, but there was an aftertaste of soap water. Which I should have known, since the glass of water they served us was disgusting!

We had ordered the jumbo sumo ramen - beware, it is a very big bowl of noodles, which we did not expect.

The sumo ramen came with a half boil egg, seaweed, pork belly, and other veggies. The noodles and pork belly was good. Soup was tasteless.

Definitely would not go back again."
29,xpJEBXTCQh5Ib8BJrjt9Bg,3,"Came here after dinner to meet up with some friends...it was nice and roomy for 7 people. 

We ordered a plate of Rosemary fries to share, which wasn't bad, however when served it was room temperature and did not taste like it just came out of the fryer.

BF had ordered a couple of beers, which he was not impressed at all with."
30,yuFdJdrnfMp3cfXVwTXjjA,3,"Wanted to give this place a try since it was in my neighbourhood and I wouldn't have to go far. Came here for a late lunch on a Friday - there was a few tables, but nothing crazy.

We had ordered:

- Spicy Miso Ramen
- Salt Broth Ramen

They were ok - can't say there were great and can't say it was terrible. The noodles had a nice texture to it, a bit chewy and not too soft. But the broth was a bit bland - definitely lacking some depth to it like another reviewer had said.

Looking at the menu, they definitely did have quite a few ramen options - perhaps too many options and they should try to narrow it down to make them better.

Perhaps next time we should try the other menu items and not the ramen."
31,xNNAfZJkLZlAeS-I7-QwgA,3,"We were here on a holiday Monday where nothing much was open. We had to grab some takeout as we were in a rush and this was the only place open.

We ordered:
- beef noodle soup
- grilled pork chop rice
- grilled port vermicelli 

The food was ok, nothing exciting and kind of bland."
32,sTV4qyjDkY5cLvx2omtLyw,4,"Nice addition to the Distillery district! Stumbled upon this place when we were out checking the lights festival. Nice place for you to hang out and get a coffee, tea or hot chocolate. They have a few flavours for hot chocolate - best part, you can get it in a dairy free option!

I had tried the peppermint hot chocolate with soy milk and it was nice and minty!

In looking at the menu, you could also grab a bite to eat or walk in their store to look at the different condiments they sell!"
33,FjTihEfjgq9dm3IJ7S888Q,4,"Cute place in Danforth and Coxwell area!

It has a nice patio to sit, which is also dog friendly! 

We had tried the wild boar pizza - which was very good! Definitely want to try the other items on the menu!

Friendly service. Definitely will be back here more often since it is so close to us!"
34,An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg,3,"my sister is a big fan of the noodles here as they do have some soup options with no MSG. 

the way the system works is that it is a combo:

- soup base option (no MSG fish soup or Chicken soup base)
- two toppings are included with additional toppings at $1.75 each
- types of noodles
- 1 hot drink is included but other options have an additional charge

Then you also have an option of adding side items.

I had ordered the parsley and century egg fish soup with fish filet, fish tofu, cabbage and flat rice noodles. Not sure if it is due to the type of noodles i had picked but i found it a little lacky in flavour.

Otherwise, it wasn't bad, pretty big portions. I would also upgrade to a cold drink next time since the hot lemon tea that i had gotten wasn't really that great."
35,n44grut83X0UiRZCA-O1fw,3,"Saw that this was in my neighbourhood so decided to give it a try!

I had purchased a regular croissant and an almond croissant.

The croissants were very flaky however I can't say I was too pleased with the regular croissant as it had a burnt taste to it (which I really don't care for).

The almond croissant was really good, I would go back for that one. They had a beautiful display of sweets which I would like to go back to try."
36,oqJe5o_4J0xkhvTSTP9UNQ,4,"Really 3.5 stars...

Wasn't bad sushi. Decent but definitely a bit on the pricier side. The rolls are slightly smaller. Shared two rolls with the hubby and felt like I wanted more and usually we feel full after 2 rolls. 

We had tried:

- Sushi Couture Maki (*Signature roll): salmon, scallop, tobiko - it typically has spicy mayo, but we asked for no mayo since the other roll had it
- Princess Maki: Spicy Tuna wrapped with Avocado, BBQ Eel, Tuna, and Salmon

Both rolls were delicious, just wish it was slightly bigger!"
37,9g4jaW7IzcuwXg86eJbynw,4,"hand made noodles. fast. great service. open kitchen. Need i to say more?

There was a line up when we got there, but it moves pretty fast (approximately 10 mins wait). As soon as the server sees you there waiting, he offers you a glass of water.

Staff is extremely friendly and nice. Service is really fast. Even faster when you speak chinese to them.

My boyfriend and I had ordered the soup dumplings, sweet and sour veggie pork noodle and a beef noodle. The soup dumplings were good, as they are made on the spot. The veggie pork handmade noodle was really good. The beef noodle, not so much.

They are definitely known more for their handmade noodles. 

Will be returning the next time I'm in town to try the spicy noodle and shanghai noodle everyone is raving about!"
38,yaViddk9vxi-7p8DnjoClw,4,"Good, cheap sushi.

The party trays in particular are a good deal!"
39,kKNauD7d3HOvumRV7JIAfg,4,"Saw that there was a new place in the neighborhood and decided to try it out. They did not disappoint!

Had ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and a classic poutine to go.

The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was excellent! It was very light and was not greasy at all! Will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.

As for the poutine... It was soggy and nothing special. Will be back to try the onion rings."
40,TR0-w6VoZDAdvFQiq7P2Ug,4,"nice and light tasting cakes! Tried an original and matcha green tea slices.

similar to Lady M cakes! 

Will be back to check on the ice cream!"
41,uN2oZDJGO078ExbbV_DGmA,1,"I give up on this place! I have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it's always been sub-par. Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.

So I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be ""rejected"" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! 

So I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance. Not worth it at ALL."
42,qbQ1qZx6eTy7pOOXMBfQNQ,2,"I think I may have been let down by this place because of all the rave reviews. But the fact is, I've eaten here twice and neither time was spectacular. 

My expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. 

The last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. 

The waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, ""The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!"" 

It took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....

We played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!

The food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous ""Boom frites"" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! 

Anyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better! 

Oh, and I disagree that it's a good place for a group. Unless you want to wait forever...or make a group by joining another couple at their picnic table!"
43,XCxxPZ3Lu5mwmIo7IQRf1g,4,"This place is always solid and the customer service always very nice. It's not the BEST Japanese\/Korean food out there, but it's consistently good. What is lacks in finesse it makes up for in portion size. The portions are huge. It's our go-to sushi place these days."
44,VTs4f6LnUMHD4ysOezHSUQ,4,"Sometimes it feels SO good to be SO bad...for you. I have been dying to try out an actual poutinerie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I've been twice now. Once I had the basic poutine and once I had the pulled pork poutine. Both are good, but I really love that pulled pork poutine. The BBQ sauce they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the fries and cheese curds. A large poutine is more than enough for two people and I liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls. I guess my only criticism is that they need more seating. Both times I've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving, but it's gross out on the street and this summer anyway, it's been SO hot outside. They don't have space for more seats, so this isn't really something they can easily fix, but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments? Anyway, if you want a very unhealthy treat, it's a go!"
45,zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ,2,"While I really enjoyed the noodles, their signature pork buns, which seemed to be something everyone orders and raves about, I did not like at all. The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. 

I liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!

To be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return. It certainly wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good either."
46,cefRDEK5O3t_iUuwnmL27Q,4,"We booked a reservation at Smith for Summerlicious. One of the major problems was finding it though. Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. 
Once inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! 
My brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. 
We ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. 
As I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. 
The desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. 
I think everyone left feeling really satisfied. 
It did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.
Basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\/not working. 
That said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!"
47,pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg,3,"Okay, so my rating has gone down from the first time I went here. 

I came again, with my family, for my birthday, at the beginning of October. Even though we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were finally seated and the waiter introduced himself...and then disappeared. Came back ten minutes later and took drink orders and then disappeared for 15 minutes...this continued the entire time. Our dinner took A LONG time. It took forever for our drinks to be served and even longer for our food to come out. Then when the food came out, we got two plates and then waited five minutes for one more plate...then waited another five minutes for another plate. It took our group 15 minutes just for us all to receive the food! Obviously we couldn't eat until everyone had been served and the food was getting cold at that point.

Oh, the best part?? Someone mentioned it was my birthday and the waiter said, ""Oh, so you're a January baby,"" indicating to when I was conceived...to my parents. Yes...thank you sir. I would really like to be reminded of my parents' doing it, right before dinner...because that's completely appropriate. 

So yes, the service this time was TERRIBLE! 

BUT, everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was really good, so there ya have it. Service hit or miss, but food is good."
48,-dy1d0ohs4D8qkJoenHNJA,1,"No...I've had it with this place. I refuse to go back. Management changed sometime last year and this place took a HUGE dive...worse than before.
There is ONE waitress who works the entire restaurant. The service is hugely lacking as a result.

Last time I went, they had half price appetizers. We were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill....oh, but SHE couldn't subtract the half price from our apps, because she needed the manager, who wasn't there to do it. So she found DIFFERENT items, that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them....well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill, based on items we didn't order????!? It was actually shockingly stupid. 

We all guessed as best we could and threw in cash...I for one threw in the towel too. The food continues to be subpar at best, the prices are not great, even with half price and the service is horrendously terrible. This place is a waste of time and money."
49,kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ,5,"I went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night. I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! 

I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small ""mall"" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! 

The decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. 

Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. 

They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. 

Our appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!

The main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!

The lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. 

I had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! 

The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? 

I was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. 

Finally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. 

This place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. 

I will definitely come back some time in the future."
50,xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g,5,"We got recommendations for this place from my parents and so, for our anniversary, we booked here. We were told though that it was first come, first served, in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the Bellagio and The Strip.
We went for lunch though, so it wasn't too busy. We were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls, with cheese and herbs infused. They were delicious!

We ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger. Our food came and was delicious. The soup was probably my favorite part. We were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert, but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse, on a decorated plate that said Happy Anniversary, which was a total surprise (they had asked when I booked if it was a special occasion, but had said nothing while we were there).
Overall the service was great, the food delicious and the view wonderful. It was a great experience!"
51,iL2pb5Khi6jV113vOVQCvA,4,"I had a craving for Mexican and came here (ie. Yelp) to figure out what we could do, because there is a very real lack of good Mexican food in Toronto. This place had some good reviews and wasn't too far away from us, so off we went.

Parking in Leaside can be pretty brutal, but we finally found a space and luckily, street parking is free. 

The restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated. 

The menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

We ordered the guacamole to start and I ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga. 

The guacamole is very delicious and creamy, but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough. We were really loading up the chips with the guacamole! 

The food came out and the was served with rice, a salad (sort of Italian dressing with feta and tomatoes) and refried beans. The salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland, but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice (I'm a wimp). 

The appetizer and our main courses came to $30 and we were VERY full. 

Service was good and food was good and it wasn't too expensive. It wasn't perfect, but we'll totally be back!"
52,bKh66jlEqEKZZFkjWipt8w,4,"Came here with my mother, husband and baby for brunch\/lunch. We were all quite happy with our choice. I think I was the ""winner"" by ordering the french toast. It was practically half a loaf of bread, covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter. My husband ordered the Stoney's breakfast, which is your basic eggs, toast, bacon, etc, meal. My mother ordered the omelet. Huge portions, BUT at around $11-$13 per breakfast meal, it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine, I'm not sure the price is warranted, especially since it's a order at the counter, then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place. People were friendly and service was good (for what it was). I would give it a try if I was in the area again."
53,s9TzmT2kZmOZkTa53D2e3g,3,"Solid soup place...has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it...you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back...usually closes the sliding window so you can't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup. Also seems to sell a selection of Jamaican movies in DVD from a glass case...sort of random.

Generous with the veggies, less so with dumplings, but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price. I wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup...would be a nice, easy add-on. But this place is what it is and doesn't bother with the bells and whistles. Really deserves a 3.5 stars. The red bean is my fav by far."
54,c78Pat78fVUBFPXYeVvbaQ,5,"I am surprised at the people complaining about the service, because we found the service to be fine. Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old ""ghetto blasters"" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it...
But the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the squash poutine was a must have, so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak, while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel. The mackerel was served first. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by bulgogi sandwich. Fresh, delicious bread and amazing bulgogi. Was very pleased. Finally the ""poutines"" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. I assumed it would be squash on top of fries. But in fact the squash was the fries. THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce ""gravies"" and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out, nor even see clearly (dim lighting). It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food. 
Other people in our party got the wings, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two ""tapas"" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30. The prices are extremely reasonable...and honestly once you try this stuff...I mean, I don't want to give them any ideas, but I would have paid more for that fine, fine food. I will be back. Need me some more of that poutine!"
55,GNEjlH_KssnJVRtqV4hAiw,4,"Our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along. I'm very pleased we went! Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a ""salad"" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. 
We each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. 
Once we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). 
We asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate. They also served it with a large basket of popcorn, which was just perfectly prepared. It was such a nice after dinner snack! I would totally come here just to order the coffee! 
It would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the coffee was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends. Make sure they're good ones, that you don't mind getting messy in front of!"
56,L6R2Op88NkoG1EGxlVvdRQ,4,"A little on the pricey end for baked goods, but the baked goods are GOOD. Also their coffee products are great. The set up is annoying (order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side), but the service is good and overall they do a good job."
57,vnIdWzIB2W4j9cDcd6tHAQ,3,"Well, we decided on a whim that we wanted Mexican food and we called around to some places that were highly rated and no seats were available. One of my favs, Chimichanga's, has disappeared, so we got to a point where we were just calling around to see WHO could take us. Finally...La Revolucion answered!

We walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!

She took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac). 

The guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!

Burritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. 

The back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: ""...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...""

When we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a ""dance party"". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.

I think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. 

I WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their ""secret recipe"" and were amazing. I had two actually.

Anyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future. Don't think I'll be going for any dance parties!"
58,ILlebFUb89ZozizpVGeHdQ,3,"Went for lunch with a friend who told me that she has had consistently good food here on prior occasions. 

My first thought though was that the restaurant was freezing cold inside, but the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was lovely.

She told us the soup of the day, which was potato garlic and said it could be ordered as a side dish. My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.

The soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. 

She was right! It really helped the soup. She said she does this with soups here all the time...which I'm not sure if a very complimentary review of the soups.

My friend said her salad was great and she liked the pepper, but agreed the cheese in the soup made it better. 

So while everything was overall A-Okay, it wasn't fantastic. It's solid though and I would go back and try something else another time."
59,R3Cg6XvdBNXXNbEu6M977A,4,"Nothing says Montreal like Montreal brick-oven cooked pizzas, right?

Okay, well maybe not, but this place was still great!

It was a complete fluke...some may venture so far as to call it fate...we walked in here off the street, looking for some dinner and decided to give it a go. Perhaps it was angels??

We ordered two pizzas and split them. One pizza = a good size meal for a person, so we were stuffed and happy at the end.

Service was good and pizzas came out fast and fresh from the oven. Nice, crispy crusts and gooey centres. Yummy!"
